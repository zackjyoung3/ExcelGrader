For the class that I am a TA for, we first put grades in a shared spreadsheet. I created this program so that the grading process could be more streamlined 
and adjustments could be more easily made. Note that the format of the file must be of the format of the excel file that I uploaded as an example. Also note that
deductions and comments must be separated by a ';' in order to be parsed correctly.
